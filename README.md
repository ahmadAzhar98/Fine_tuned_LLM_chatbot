# Chatbot

This large language model is fine-tuned on a dataset provided by Codebasics. The purpose of this chatbot is to assist students who are considering enrolling in a course and have questions. Previously, when students asked questions, Codebasics employees would refer to an Excel file containing pre-written answers to frequently asked questions, copying and pasting responses as needed. However, as the number of questions grew over time, this process became cumbersome and inefficient.

To address this issue, I designed a chatbot for Codebasics. The chatbot streamlines the process by providing instant, automated responses to student inquiries, reducing the workload on employees while ensuring students get quick and accurate answers
